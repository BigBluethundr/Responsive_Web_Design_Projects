<ol id="tribute-info" class="Vegi">
<li>Lets start off by saying that the general disrespect <i>The Prince of ALL Saiyans</i> hereby known as Vegeta recieves
from the entire cast of Dragon Ball is outright infuriating. While argueably always being or becoming second best
he works harder than any other to attain the power levels he has reached.</li>
<li>Even from a young age he trained harder than any of his peers, exceeding the general of the entire Saiyan army 
as a adolescent. While some may argue he had a bad attitude put yourself in his shoes. Imagine being a man destined 
to rule the elite warrior race, while on a mission your entire world is wiped from existence, and you are left
with a handful of weak warriors to rebuild the Saiyan race. Then imagine sending one of the few remaining members
of your race to retrieve another remaining member just to have them killed by a 3rd class Saiyan, the weakest of
your entire race. Then imagine that same Saiyan disabled your closest friend (forcing you to put them down) and
nearly killed you, granting you, his rightful king, mercy allowing you to crawl away in shame.</li>
<li>I would call his attitude understandable if not expected. Then to top it all off, only a month later you
are once again saved by your rival, and forced to watch as he easily defeats the strongest members of the Freeza force
with little to no effort. </li>
<li>Next, when you return the favor and bail out the only surviving member of your race because he was too stupid
to defend himself against Captain Ginyu, you don't even recieve a thank you. Meanwhile you have to fight the most
powerful being in the universe for an extended period of time to ensure your rival heals. When he does finally heal
he literally lets you die. </li>
<li>Finally, once you think its over, you are free of this worthless Saiyan trash you are revived just in time
to see him become the legendary Super Saiyan that you were destined to become, killing Lord Freeza, the destroyer
of your entire race.</li>
<li>After that you are wisked away to Earth, a planet you were meant to destroy, and forced to play nice with the
inhabitants there, the same people that fought you only weeks prior.</li>
<li>Eventually, after years of training you become the legendary Super Saiyan just to have a man named after a rotten
cuccumber (Piccolo) merge with Kami(effectively a God) and surpass your power once again.</li>
<li>Honestly, everything Vegeta has since the fall of his race is earned, he is a good husband and father, he trains
longer and harder than any other fighter and is always surpassed and made into a second class citizen. He is the 
true victim, he deserves the praise and respect of his peers, yet he is always counted out until Kakarot is dead, or
defeated, or training on King Kai's planet, then everyone suddenly needs him. It isn't right and it isn't fair.</li>
<li>Even his own attack <a id="tribute-link" href="http://dragonball.wikia.com/wiki/Final_Explosion" target="_blank">Final Explosion</a> was him sacrificing
his life vs Magin Buu to try and save the Earth and his loved ones but did he recieve any public acknoledgment for it... NO.</li>
